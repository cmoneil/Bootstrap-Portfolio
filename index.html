                    </div>

                    <img src="assets/images/bio_img2.jpg" class="img-fluid img-box" alt="Me in Portovenere">
                    <div class="about">
                        <p>I grew up and have lived in the Midwest my whole life. I guess Minnesotans don't really consider
                            themselves Midwesterners but everyone in Minnesota thinks I'm from the south because I lived
                            in Kansas. Kansas is not in the south. Its right in the middle of the country. Though anytime
                            I go back to visit there, I seem to pick up a "southern accent". Its not an Alabama southern
                            accent but its definitely not a Minnesota accent. I have now lived in Minnesota longer than anywhere
                            else so I guess I am now more Minnesotan than anything.</p>



                        <p>The picture to the left was taken in Portovenere, Italy. It's right on the coast of Italy and is
                            just to the south of Cinque Terre. My wife and I went there and the end of our honeymoon in the
                            summer of 2017. We did a whirlwind European honeymoon. It was 2 weeks but we managed to go to
                            6 different cities so it was long but we crammed in a lot of Europe. It was definitely the best
                            trip of my life. I have had some really good trips before but this was my first as a husband
                            and it made it that much better.
                        </p>



                        <p>I attended the University of Kansas and graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology. I have
                            worked in advertising, banking, retail, and printing since graduation, but nothing directly related
                            to my degree. I still follow everything KU related even the football team even if they may be
                            the worst D1 football in the country. You would think that a school that has one of the best
                            basketball programs in the country could at least field a decent football team.
